            Skretcher is a project created by two second-year Front-End Development students at
            Noroff. The name Skretcher is a combination of our last names, reflecting the
            collaboration behind the project.

            In this project, we have focused on building a clear and well-organised platform, with
            attention to functionality, reusable components, scalability, and the use of dark design
            patterns as part of the concept. The goal has been to create a system that is both
            technically structured and easy to navigate.

            Skretcher is still a work in progress and not yet a finished product. We see it as an
            evolving project and look forward to continuing to develop and improve it as we move
            forward in our studies.
